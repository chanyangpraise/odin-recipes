<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>5 cups bread flour, divided, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle warm beer
        </li>
        <li>Â¼ cup warm water

        </li>
        <li>3 tablespoons shortening

        </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon instant yeast

        </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar

        </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt

        </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder

        </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder

        </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or to taste, divided

        </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cornmeal, or as needed

        </li>
        <li>16 sticks string cheese

        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<p>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine 4 cups bread flour, beer, water, shortening, yeast, brown sugar, salt, garlic powder, and onion powder in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment; mix until combined. With the mixer running, add remaining flour, a little at a time, until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl and forms into a ball, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Lightly grease a large bowl with 1 teaspoon olive oil. Place dough into the bowl. Cover with a clean towel and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.

        </li>
        <li>Grease 2 pizza pans with remaining 2 teaspoons olive oil; dust with cornmeal.
        </li>
        <li>Punch dough down gently and divide into 2 equal portions. Place each portion onto a prepared pan. Cover and let rest for about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stretch each dough out 1 inch past the edge of the pan. If dough shrinks back when stretched, cover and let rest for 5 more minutes before stretching again.</li>
        <li>Arrange 8 sticks cheese, ends touching, around the edge of 1 pan. Fold overhang over cheese and press dough to seal. Repeat with the second pan.</li>
    </ol>
</p>
